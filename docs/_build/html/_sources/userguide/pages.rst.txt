*This document will explain what information can be found on every page of the application.
The bold text corresponds with the pages in the menu of the application.*


Home
====

This is the homepage of the application. Here you can find succinct explanations of the pages.
There's not much else going on.


Search repository
=================

This page leads to a form which you can fill in to filter repositories.
You can fill in:

    * A word to search for the name of a repository
    * Select a BP from the list
    * Select if the result is in the scope or not

The result will be a table similar to the one described in **Full Table**


Search module
=============

This page leads to a form which you can fill in to filter modules.
You can fill in:

    * A word or even a couple of words (multiple words will only work if 'search readme'
    is checked)
    * Which version the module needs to exist in
    * If the module is installable (yes/no/both)
    * And a checkbox to indicate if the readme should be checked too, instead of only the name

The result will be a table similar to the one described in **Table per Version**.
With the exception of an added column:

* Repository: links to the **Table per Version** table for that repository.


Full table
==========

This page leads to a table that focuses on providing an overview.
When you click on "Full Table" in the menu, you will see a table filled with all existing repositories.

The rows contain a number of columns:

    * Repository: The name of the repository
    * Description: A very short description of the repository, this does not exist for all repositories
    * In Scope: The repository is in the scope of the company (True/False)
    * BP: Which BP that is linked to this repository
    * Employee.: An assignee who has experience with this repository
    * Edit Repository: You can click here to edit a couple of options for this repository:
        * BP
        * In Scope
        * Employee

If you click on a repository name, you will see a table filled with modules next. This are
all the modules that are in the selected repository. In the columns you can see for which
version every module exists. If it exists, it is indicated as such by a 'X'.
Clicking the 'X' will take you to the corresponding OCA page.
If the module does not exist in a version, a '-'  will be shown.


Table per version
=================

This page leads to a table that focuses on detail.
First you will be required to select an Odoo version from version 8 to 11.
After that you are redirected to a table consisting of repositories.
Each of these repositories contain modules for the selected version.
If a repository does not contain existing modules for the selected version, it is not shown.

You will see the same columns as with **Full Table**, but less rows.
This is because not every module exists in every repository.

You can click on every Repository. Doing so will present you with a table of modules that are
part of the repository. Again, you are greeted by a number of rows and columns.

    * Addon: The name of the module
    * Readme: If a readme-file exists for this module, a clickable link is shown here
    * Installable: This field indicates if the module is installable or not
    * OCA: This is a clickable link to the module on OCA
    * Rating: A user can input a rating using 'write review' which will be shown here
    * Review: A user can input a review using 'write review' which will be shown here
    * Write Review: A clickable link to write a review and assign a score
